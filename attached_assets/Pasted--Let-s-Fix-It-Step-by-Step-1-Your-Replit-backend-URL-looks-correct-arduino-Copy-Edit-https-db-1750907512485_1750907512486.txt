✅ Let's Fix It Step-by-Step
✅ 1. Your Replit backend URL looks correct:
arduino
Copy
Edit
https://db0de57c-0227-4a6d-a48b-bd0f45c473a6-00-srrgnf845gfb.riker.replit.dev
🔍 2. Test the backend directly
Visit this test link in your browser:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://db0de57c-0227-4a6d-a48b-bd0f45c473a6-00-srrgnf845gfb.riker.replit.dev/api/test
If it works, you should see something like:

json
Copy
Edit
{"message":"API is working"}
If you see "Replit: Not found" or anything in HTML, that means your Replit backend is asleep, erroring, or routes aren't exposed.

✅ 3. Confirm your Vercel environment variable is pointing to the backend
You already set:

ini
Copy
Edit
VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://db0de57c-0227-4a6d-a48b-bd0f45c473a6-00-srrgnf845gfb.riker.replit.dev
Perfect. Just make sure:

Your frontend code is using:

ts
Copy
Edit
const BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL;
And all axios/fetch calls are based on that BASE_URL

🔁 4. After updating the .env, you must re-deploy your frontend on Vercel:
You already redeployed ✅ — but do it again now just in case:

Go to Vercel → Deployments → Redeploy Latest

💡 5. Try from the browser console (manually test login)
Use this in Chrome DevTools (Console tab):

js
Copy
Edit
fetch("https://db0de57c-0227-4a6d-a48b-bd0f45c473a6-00-srrgnf845gfb.riker.replit.dev/api/login", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: "tornevelk1@gmail.com",
    password: "TorneLea1!",
    role: "parent"
  })
}).then(res => res.json()).then(console.log).catch(console.error);
If this fails, the backend is broken. If it works, the frontend is misconfigured.

🚨 If Your Backend is Not Responding
Then:

Go to your Replit project

Click the "Run" button

Open the logs

Make sure routes like /api/login or /api/test are printing or responding

✅ Once backend is confirmed working:
You’ve already updated VITE_API_BASE_URL in Vercel

You’ve already changed the code to use VITE_API_BASE_URL

Redeploy once more

Try logging in again

If you want, I can give you the exact code snippet to paste into your frontend queryClient.ts or axios.ts to confirm it’s wired correctly — just let me know which file handles your API calls.

Let’s get this working now 💪

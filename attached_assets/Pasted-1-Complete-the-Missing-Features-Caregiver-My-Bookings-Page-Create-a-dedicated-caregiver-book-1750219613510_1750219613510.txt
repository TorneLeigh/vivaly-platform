1. Complete the Missing Features
Caregiver “My Bookings” Page

👉 Create a dedicated /caregiver/bookings React page (not redirecting to profile).

Use the calendar component and the /api/caregiver/bookings endpoint you already wired up.

“Recent Applications” → Job Details Link

In your Caregiver Dashboard’s “Recent Applications” list, change the “View job details” button to link to

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Link href={`/job/${app.jobId}`}>
  View job details
</Link>
Make sure you have a route for /job/:jobId pointing at your JobDetails component.

Remove Any Stray Referral Pop-ups

Audit any <Modal> or <ReferralBanner> calls in the caregiver pages—only show the inline banner at the top of Profile/Dashboard.

Once those pieces are in place, every button should land on a real page (no more 404s or round-trips back to “Profile”).

2. Run a Full End-to-End Smoke Test
A. Parent Flow
Signup/Login as a Parent.

Complete Profile (photo, suburb, WWCC, etc.) → confirm banner appears.

Post a Job → you should be redirected to the Job Board.

Visit My Jobs (“Active Job Posts” on your profile) → see your listing + “Applicants: 0.”

B. Caregiver Flow
Switch Role (or signup) as a Caregiver.

Complete Profile (intro video, experience, WWCC) → confirm banner appears.

Browse Job Board → see the job you just posted.

Apply → application shows in Recent Applications, and the “View job details” link now works.

C. Messaging & Booking
Parent opens Messages → two-way chat shows both sides, with “View Profile” buttons.

Parent accepts an application → triggers a booking record.

Caregiver goes to My Bookings → calendar highlights that date and shows the appointment.

Parent goes to My Bookings → sees the same confirmed booking on their calendar.

Next Steps
Build in the two missing pages (caregiver bookings + job details linking) as above.

Run through the smoke test yourself or with a colleague.

Fix any remaining 404s or data gaps you encounter in those flows.

Once everything clicks end-to-end, you’re ready to invite real users!

If you’d like, I can send you the exact React/TS code snippets for the caregiver bookings page and the application-to-details links. Just let me know!
